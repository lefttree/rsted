Quick Start
====================

All settings here are default settings.

Wifi
----------------------

        Connect Wifi antenna to IO module::

                Wifi Security Mode -- Secure
                Wifi Antenna -- External
                Wifi Channel -- 5Ghz, 40
                Wifi Standard -- 80211a
                Wifi AP Mode -- NAT
                wifi id -- <your wifi id>
                wifi password -- <your wifi password>
                AP IP -- 172.30.254.1 
                AP Netmask -- 255.255.0.0
                AP Gateway -- 172.30.254.1
                leasetime -- 600
                start ip -- 172.30.254.100
                stop ip -- 172.30.254.200

        Click "Apply"/"Save and Apply"

        Use your wifi supported device to connect to this wifi

PTT
---------------------

        Connect headset to IO module::

                Channel 1 -- 239.0.0.190
                Microphone volume -- 70
                Speaker volume -- 85

        | Enable Push to Talk and click "Apply"/"Save and Apply"
        | Make sure Radios are connected(LED light is green)
        | Now you can user push to talk function normally

Video Encoder
--------------------

        | Connect Camera to IO module

        Default settings are as following::

                Video Format -- NTSC
                Codec Combination -- H264
                H264 Profile -- Main Profile
                Resolution(Primary and Secondary) -- 4CIF
                Frame rate(Primary and Secondary) -- 25fps
                Bitrate -- 1Mbps
                Quality factor of MJPEG -- 80
                Brightness/Contrast/Saturation -- 128

        Now you can watch the video in VLC player through the H.264 link

GPS
--------------------


        | Select antenna and enable GPS
        | On **radio's** webinterface, point your GPS server ip to IO Module's ip
        | After GPS is locked, you could see updated GPS locations of radios on Mapoverlay page
